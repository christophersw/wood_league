Title: draw_rate_fens.py — curated opening positions for draw-rate calibration
Description:
    Small fixed set of post-opening FENs used when repeated start-position
    sampling is deterministic (single-thread search). Mainline, roughly
    balanced positions so the measured draw rate reflects the network's
    inherent drawishness rather than opening sharpness.
Changelog:
    2026-05-19: Initial creation (issue #159).
